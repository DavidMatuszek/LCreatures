LCreatures

In the 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, Richard Dawkins described a program (also called Blind Watchmaker) that simulated evolution. The user started with a very simple figure (a short line) and, by generating variations on that figure and choosing the most appealing, could create some very interesting "biomorphs." It was also possible to directly manipulate the "chromosomes" of the biomorphs.

I've never found the code for this program, and often thought about building my own version. The book Processing: Creative Coding and Generative Art in Processing 2, by Ira Greenberg, Dianna Xu and Deepak Kumar, contains a description of L-systems, and these seemed to me to be a good basis for a Blind Watchmaker-type program.
